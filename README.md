# bmp085_wiringpi_only
Read BMP085 sensor from Rasperry Pi using only native c++, uses only wiringPi library

THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE C++ CODE FOR READING BMP08 VALUES WITH C++ USING ONLY WIRING PI.
I HAVE USED MANY PYTHON SCRIPTS, MANY OF THEM ARE *BUGGY AND FEELS LIKE SENSOR IS NOT ACCURATE
IN CORONA DAYS I HAD TIME TO READ DATASHEET OF BMP085 AND WRITE THIS CODE.
MANY LIBRARIES AND PYTHON SCRIPTS ARE FAILING TO READ ACCURATE DATA BECAUSE OF USING WRONG 
VARIABLES FOR REGISTERS. 
ACTUALLY THIS SENSOR IS GREAT AND VERY ACCURATE. (+- 0.1 C DEGREES IN TEMPERATURE READING)
I THINK ALL REGISTER AND CALCULATION VALUES ARE SAME FOR BML180 SENSOR ALSO, BUT I HAVENT TRIED.

* ONLY WIRING_PI LIBRARY IS REQUIRED TO COMPILE THIS CODE.

with
- sudo apt install wiringpi       
you can install wiringpi library if not installed already.

- when compiling your code you must reference wiringpi library 

- g++ yoursourcefile.cpp -o executable -lwiringPI

Thats all. I TRIED TO MAKE IT SIMPLE AS IT CAN BE FOR EASLY ADAPTING TO YOUR C++ PROJECTS/

HAPPY CODING.

PS. FEEL FREE TO USE THIS CODE ANY OF YOUR PROJECTS, ACTUALLY I MADE IT FOR DETECTING VERY LITTLE CHANGES 
IN TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, AND SENSOR IS DOING A GREAT JOB AND IT IS STABLE.
AND COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ARE WELCOME PLEASE WRITE ME TO

WARNING = IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS CODE IN A SERVICE LIKE DAEMON, 
YOU MUST CALL WIRINGPISETUP() AND WIRINGPII2CSETUP() FUNCTIONS 
ONLY ONCE!!! DONT PUT THEM INSIDE ANY OF YOUR LOOPS !!!
